hypertension atenolol tablets usp are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions these benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol usp control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management including as appropriate lipid control diabetes management antithrombotic therapy smoking cessation exercise and limited sodium intake many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals for specific advice on goals and management see published guidelines such as those of the national high blood pressure education program s joint national committee on prevention detection evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure jnc numerous antihypertensive drugs from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs that is largely responsible for those benefits the largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk and the absolute risk increase per mmhg is greater at higher blood pressures so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension for example patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects as monotherapy in black patients and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects e g on angina heart failure or diabetic kidney disease these considerations may guide selection of therapy atenolol tablets usp may be administered with other antihypertensive agents angina pectoris due to coronary atherosclerosis atenolol tablets usp are indicated for the long term management of patients with angina pectoris acute myocardial infarction atenolol tablets usp are indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient s clinical condition allows see dosage and administration contraindications and warnings in general there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the isis 1 trial blood pressure less than 1 mm hg systolic heart rate less than 5 bpm or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade as noted above some subgroups e g elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 12 mm hg seemed less likely to benefit

methenamine mandelate usp is indicated for the suppression or elimination of bacteriuria associated with pyelonephritis cystitis and other chronic urinary tract infections also for infected residual urine sometimes accompanying neurologic diseases when used as recommended methenamine mandelate usp is particularly suitable for long term therapy because of its safety and because resistance to the nonspecific bactericidal action of formaldehyde does not develop pathogens resistant to other antibacterial agents may respond to methenamine mandelate usp because of the nonspecific effect of formaldehyde formed in an acid urine prophylactic use rationale urine is a good culture medium for many urinary pathogens inoculation by a few organisms relapse or reinfection may lead to bacteriuria in susceptible individuals thus the rationale of management in recurring urinary tract infection bacteriuria is to change the urine from a growth supporting to a growth inhibiting medium there is a growing body of evidence that long term administration of methenamine mandelate usp can prevent the recurrence of bacteriuria in patients with chronic pyelonephritis therapeutic use rationale methenamine mandelate usp helps to sterilize the urine and in some situations in which underlying pathologic conditions prevent sterilization by any means it can help to suppress the bacteriuria methenamine mandelate usp should not be used alone for acute infections with parenchymal involvement causing systemic symptoms such as chills and fever a thorough diagnostic investigation as a part of the overall management of the urinary tract infection should accompany the use of methenamine mandelate usp

thiola r cystine stones typically occur in approximately 1 persons in the united states who are homozygous for cystinuria these persons excrete abnormal amounts of cystine in urine of over 25 mg g creatinine as well as excessive amounts of other dibasic amino acids lysine arginine and ornithine in addition they show varying intestinal transport defects for these same amino acids the stone formation is the result of poor aqueous solubility of cystine since there are no known inhibitors of the crystallization of cystine the stone formation is determined primarily by the urinary supersaturation of cystine thus cystine stones could theoretically form whenever urinary cystine concentration exceeds the solubility limit cystine solubility in urine is ph dependent and ranges from 17 3 mg liter at ph 5 19 4 mg liter at ph 7 and 22 5 mg liter at ph 7 5 the goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit it may be accomplished by dietary means aimed at reducing cystine synthesis and by a high fluid intake in order to increase urine volume and thereby lower cystine concentration unfortunately the above conservative measures alone may be ineffective in controlling cystine stone formation in some homozygous patients with severe cystinuria urinary cystine exceeding 5 mg day in such patients d penicillamine has been used as an additional therapy like thiola tm however d penicillamine treatment is frequently accompanied by adverse reactions such as dermatologic complications hypersensitivity reactions hematologic abnormalities and renal disturbances thiola a r
